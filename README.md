# üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Pride War Flags üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

Inspired by the tradition of [national war flags][wiki_war_flag] and <a href="https://x.com/delatoid/status/1739070143370862906" title="Delat on X: &quot;I had a dream where there were 2 non-binary flags The regular one was for peacetime, but when we went to war we would swap the white and black stripes&quot;">this tweet<br /><img src="https://i.redd.it/viax8r680j8c1.png" alt="Screenshot of a tweet: &quot;I had a dream where there were 2 non-binary flags The regular one was for peacetime, but when we went to war we would swap the white and black stripes&quot;" style="width: 33.33%;" /></a><br />I wanted to design and/or collect other pride war flags.

I am bisexual, so when I saw [delatoids][delatoid_reddit]'s tweet ([Via this reddit post][nb_flag_reddit]), I immediately had some ideas for a wartime bisexual pride flag&mdash;we swing both ways, after all, violently; with a sword. I am also including delatoid's wartime nonbinary flag and my take on the wartime transgender flag as suggested by [War-Weasel][war_weasel_comment] in a comment on the Reddit post. If I have what I think are good ideas for any others, I will add them, but I would love community contributions. I don't feel like it would be right for me to design flags for identities I do not claim.

Also included: a Bisexual [Jack][wiki_jack] and Bisexual, Transgender, and Progress Pride [Ensigns][wiki_naval_ensign], because I once I got started, I couldn't stop.
